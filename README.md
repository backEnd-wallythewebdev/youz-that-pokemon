Let Node JS tell you which Pokemon you are

**Idea**

Started to make Http requests using node, got super excited (geeking out they call it) and wanted to use user input to return the pokemon that they should be based on there input like: 

```
age = evelution
fire sign = element

date of brith (day) = number of chosen pokemon
date of birth (month) = if number is over 30, the devision of number

```

**this is a work in progress and is a base idea for how to generate user Avatars**

**terminal command is**: 
```
node app.js 
```

**Tasks for this app**

- [x] connect to api and retrive pokemon data
- [x] Randomise the returned pokemon for the user
- [ ] create a UI ineterface for the user
- [ ] Allow user to input custom details to narrow pokemon selection
- [ ] return to user pokemon picture

**Optomise**

- [ ] find way to load only the selected number so that api call does not need to be made for full amount
not sure if this is possible but will check documentation
